# INTEXMummySiteDemo_2021
## Overview
This project is designed to build a prototype website for the BYU Archeological Department to better organize and access their own data. Not only is the website meant to be used at their desks for research purposes but also out in the field when they are trying to record important information about the Egyptian archeological findings they find.

## Layout
The application uses the ASP.NET framework for building and running the website.

## Launch
To launch the application, download the repository, install Visual Studio, and click the launch button.
